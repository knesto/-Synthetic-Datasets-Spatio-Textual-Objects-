# -Synthetic-Datasets-Spatio-Textual-Objects

In this implementation, two Synthetic Datasets are generated with 1 million spatial objects per Dataset. For the first Dataset, data follows a uniform distribution. For the second dataset, data follows a non-uniform distribution using a normal distribution creating five clusters in space.
Each object of two datasets is assigned with a random number of keywords between 1 and 5, and these keywords are selected from a vocabulary of 9,000 records. The total size of the file (keywords.txt) is 90.5 KB. The keywords include weights. The first 3,000 keywords has a weight of 10, the next 3,000 keywords has a weight of 30, and the last 3,000 keywords has a weight of 60, so that three frequency categories are created: high, medium and low for the keyword selection.
