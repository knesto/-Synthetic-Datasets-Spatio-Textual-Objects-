# -Synthetic-Datasets-Spatio-Textual-Objects

On this implementation, two Synthetic Datasets are generared with 1 million spatial objects per Dataset. For the first Dataset, data follows a uniform distribution and for the second dataset, data folows a non-uniform distribution using a normal distribution creating five clusters in space.
Each object of two datasets is assigned with a random number of keywords between 1 and 5, and these keywords are selected from a vocabulary of size 9,000 records. The total size of the file (keywords.txt) is 90,5 KB. The keywords includes weights, the first 3000 keywords has weight 10 the next 3000 keywords has weight 30 and the last 3000 keywords has weight 60 so three frequency categories are created high, medium and low for the keyword selection.
